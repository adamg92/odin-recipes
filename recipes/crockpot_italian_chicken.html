    <h3>You only need 3 ingredients for this crockpot Italian chicken with Italian dressing and Parmesan cheese.</h3>
    
    <br>

    <p>Nothing could be easier than this for a weekday meal that's ready when you get home.</p>
    <p>If you’re looking for easy, delicious meals, save this one! The prep could not be any quicker or easier, and the flavor is lovely. I served it with rice and asparagus, but it would be tasty over some angel hair or linguini pasta as well.</p>
